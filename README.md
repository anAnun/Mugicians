# Mugicians
Personal application which "acts" like GitHub but for musicians, songwriters, and bandmates.
Allows one person to hold the master account and gives the authorized bandmates/musicians access to the audiofiles, songs, lyrics, and the ability to create pull requests.
Currently working on adding login capabilities on the server side and sql.
Took it off Azure to perform tests and add code.
